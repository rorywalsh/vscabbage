> Cabbage 3 and the associated Visual Studio Code extension are currently in ***Alpha*** development. These releases are experimental and may undergo significant changes. Features are not final, and stability or performance may vary. Use at your own discretion, and expect frequent updates and potential breaking changes. Please report any issues on the Cabbage [forum](https://forum.cabbageaudio.com/).
 
Cabbage is a powerful and flexible software framework designed for prototyping and developing audio instruments using the Csound audio synthesis language. It offers an integrated workflow tailored for sound designers, musicians, composers, and developers who want to build custom synthesizers, audio effects, and interactive sound tools. With its seamless blend of coding, audio processing, and interface design, Cabbage enables rapid experimentation while maintaining professional-grade results.

Instrument development is streamlined through a dedicated Cabbage extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension enhances the development experience with features such as syntax highlighting, intelligent code assistance, real-time previews, and a set of tools built specifically to support the Cabbage/Csound workflow. These capabilities allow users to iterate quickly and efficiently without leaving the editor.

Beyond audio processing, Cabbage includes a built-in graphical UI editor that lets users design and customize instrument frontends directly within VS Code. This integrated editor makes it easy to create visually polished, interactive interfaces—complete with sliders, buttons, meters, and more—without relying on external design tools. When an instrument is ready, Cabbage can export it as a fully functional audio plugin in VST3 or AU formats, enabling smooth integration into digital audio workstations across multiple platforms.

This repository contains the source code for the Cabbage Visual Studio Code extension. The extension serves as a bridge between VS Code and the Cabbage plugin-development framework for Csound, providing all the tools necessary to create, edit, preview, and test Cabbage instruments directly inside the editor.
