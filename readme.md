> Cabbage 3 and the associated Visual Studio Code extension are currently in ***Alpha*** development. These releases are experimental and may undergo significant changes. Features are not final, and stability or performance may vary. Use at your own discretion, and expect frequent updates and potential breaking changes.

This repository contains the source code for the Cabbage Visual Studio Code extension, which provides an interface to the Cabbage plugin development framework for Csound within Visual Studio Code. The extension allows users to create, edit, and test Cabbage instruments directly within VS Code. More info can be found [here](https://rorywalsh.github.io/cabbage3docs/docs/intro)
